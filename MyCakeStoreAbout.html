            <h2>About Our Store</h2>
            <p>We opened our doors in 1976. Being a mom and pop store, our cakes have a sense of design and style that is found no where else. Many even say our craftsmenship creates a feeling of warmth, and evokes a curiosity of what else is there to dive into. </p>

            <h2>Our Cakes</h2>
            <p>The little fancy cakes and other fun loving favorite sports team of confections can bring joy.  Nowadays, at least among fellow neighbors, to oversee, not participate, in the baking process, has almost made the art of cake making extinct. Cake is a luxury always, and should be regarded as such. </p>
